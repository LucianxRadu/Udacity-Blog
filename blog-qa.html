          Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at
          your side, kid. You mean it controls your actions? The Force is strong
          with this one. I have you now. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
          You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were
          beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to
          the plans they sent you. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a
          traitor! Take her away! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the
          responsibility yourself. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
          I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
          Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
          Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Don't act
          so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this
          time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I
          want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. You are a part
          of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Alderaan? I'm not
          going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it
          is. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?
          Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport
          there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Ye-ha! I don't know what
          you're talking about.

          I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to
          Alderaan-- I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me
          here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my
          father before me. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the
          responsibility yourself. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the
          more star systems will slip through your fingers. I can't get
          involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate
          it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long
          way from here. Don't underestimate the Force. I have traced the Rebel
          spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
          The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Red Five standing
          by. He is here. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The Force
          is strong with this one. I have you now. Don't underestimate the
          Force. What!? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.
          Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I don't know
          what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a
          diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

          Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at,
          ain't it? Ye-ha! As you wish. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this
          thing and go home! No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You
          can't possibly… I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm
          getting too old for this sort of thing. In my experience, there is no
          such thing as luck. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match
          for a good blaster at your side, kid. Kid, I've flown from one side of
          this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've
          never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force
          controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls
          my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. The plans
          you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Don't underestimate the
          Force. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You don't
          believe in the Force, do you? I have traced the Rebel spies to her.
          Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

          Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that
          all on board were killed. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna
          explain this? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've
          constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to
          the power of the Force. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Hey,
          Luke! May the Force be with you. I find your lack of faith disturbing.
