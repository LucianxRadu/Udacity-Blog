          Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has
          to happen. Makes me a … scientist. I'm partial to air conditioning.
          I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted
          until the dark became my world and I could see. I will not kill my
          sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.

          Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. This man
          is a knight in shining armor. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!
          Tell him time is of the essence. Cops, another community I'm not part
          of.

          I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I
          think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm generally confused most of the
          time. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.
          Like a sloth. I can do that. He taught me a code. To survive. You all
          right, Dexter? Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss.
          After all, you are a client. Keep your mind limber. Hello, Dexter
          Morgan. This man is a knight in shining armor. Only you could make
          those words cute.

          I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I love Halloween. The one time
          of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Hello, Dexter
          Morgan. Like a sloth. I can do that. Tell him time is of the essence.
          Watching ice melt. This is fun. You all right, Dexter? He taught me a
          code. To survive. You look…perfect. I'm generally confused most of the
          time. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm
          doing mental jumping jacks. Tonight's the night. And it's going to
          happen again and again. It has to happen. You all right, Dexter? I'm
          generally confused most of the time. I'm a sociopath; there's not much
          he can do for me. I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person.
          I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.
          Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the
          people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I'm not the
          monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something
          new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

          You look…perfect. Like a sloth. I can do that. I feel like a jigsaw
          puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should
          be. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure
